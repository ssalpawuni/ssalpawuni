Salpawuni's research interests include the applications of survival analysis in Medicine, sequential decision processes, and the use of `R` and `Python` as programmable tools to data mining. Currently, he is working on his dissertation titled; "Applications of Survival Analysis in Medicine: Bayesian and Frequentist Approaches". He is also a member of the Bayesian statistics group in the Department of Statistics that seeks to use novel concepts of Bayesian statistics to shape decision making.

Prior to enrolling for his doctoral studies, Salpawuni served as an assistant Biostatistics tutor at the School of Anesthesia, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). He has also taught various courses in Statistics, on private bases. Whiles still on his graduate studies, he is also a freelancer on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/ssalpawuni?up_rollout=true) where he primarily renders services in data analysis using `R` and `Python`.
