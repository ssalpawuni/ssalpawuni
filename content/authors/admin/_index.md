title: Dr. Abubakari S. Sumaila

Dr. Abubakari S. Sumaila earned his PhD in Statistics from [Yildiz Technical 
University](https://www.yildiz.edu.tr/), Istanbul, focusing on bioinformatics and melanoma research. His 
dissertation, titled "Survival Modeling in Cutaneous Melanoma via Integrative 
Transcriptomic and Epigenetic Bioinformatics" was based on the application of 
advanced statistical methods in multi-omics modeling for novel biomarker 
discovery and their translational potential. Abubakari’s academic interests 
include survival analysis in medicine, sequential 
decision processes, and statistical programming—particularly using `R` and 
`Python` for data mining and translational research in biological systems. 
Prior to enrolling for his doctoral studies, Abubakari served as an assistant 
Biostatistics tutor at the School of Anesthesia, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital 
(KATH). He has also taught various courses in Statistics, on a private basis. 
While he was doing his graduate studies, he worked as a freelancer on 
[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/ssalpawuni?up_rollout=true), 
where he primarily rendered services in data analysis using `R` and `Python`. 
In his free time, Abubakari enjoys watching football, reading science fiction, 
and photography.
