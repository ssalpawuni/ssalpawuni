abstract: "Survival analysis plays a central role in diverse research fields, 
especially in health sciences. As an analytical tool, it can be used to help 
improve patients’ survival time, or at least, reduce the prospects of recurrence 
in cancer studies. However, approaches to the predictive performance of the current 
survival models mainly center on clinical data along with the classical survival 
methods. For censored “omics” data, the performance of survival models has not 
been thoroughly studied, either often due to their high dimensionality issues or 
reliance on binarizing the survival time for classification analysis. We aim to 
present a neural benchmark approach that analyzes and compares a broad range of 
classical and state-of-the-art machine learning survival models for “omics” and 
clinical datasets. All the methods considered in our study are evaluated using 
predictability as a performance measure. The study is systematically designed to 
make 36 comparisons (9 methods over 4 datasets, i.e., 2 clinical and 2 omics), 
and shows that, in practice, predictability of survival models does vary across 
real-world datasets, model choice, as well as the evaluation metric. From our 
results, we emphasize that performance criteria can play a key role in a 
balanced assessment of diverse survival models. Moreover, the Multitask 
Logistic Regression (MTLR) showed remarkable predictability for almost all the 
datasets. We believe this outstanding performance presents a unique opportunity 
for a wider use of MTLR for survival risk factors. For translational clinicians 
and scientists, we hope our findings provide practical guidance for benchmark 
studies of survival models, as well as highlight potential areas of research interest."
