abstract: '**Background/Objectives:** Cutaneous melanoma is one of the aggressive forms of skin cancer originating from melanocytes. The high incidence of melanoma metastasis continues to rise, partly due to the complex nature of the molecular mechanisms driving its progression. While melanomas generally arise from melanocytes, we investigated whether aberrant keratinocyte differentiation pathways—like cornified envelope formation—discriminate primary melanoma from metastatic melanoma, revealing novel biomarkers in progres- sion. **Methods:** In the present study, we retrieved four datasets (GSE15605, GSE46517, GSE8401, and GSE7553) associated with primary and metastatic melanoma tissues and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Thereafter, an integrated meta-analysis and functional enrichment analysis of the DEGs were performed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma metastasis, such as immune cell deconvolution and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Hub genes were identified based on four topological methods, including ‘Betweenness’, ‘MCC’, ‘Degree’, and ‘Bottleneck’. We validated the findings using the TCGA-SKCM cohort. Drug-gene interactions were evaluated using the DGIdb, whereas structural druggability was assessed using the Pro- teinPlus and AlphaFold databases. **Results:** We identified a total of eleven hub genes associated with melanoma progression. These included members of the keratin gene family (e.g., KRT5, KRT6A, KRT6B, etc.). Except for the gene CDH1, all the hub genes were down- regulated in metastatic melanoma tissues. From a prognostic perspective, these hub genes were associated with poor prognosis (i.e., unfavorable). Using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), immunohistochemistry evaluation revealed mostly undetected levels in metastatic melanoma. Additionally, the cornified envelope formation was the most enriched pathway, with a gene ratio of 17/33. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of metastatic melanomas was predominantly enriched in NK cell–associated signatures. Finally, several hub genes demonstrated favorable druggable potential for immunotherapy. **Conclusions:** Through integrated meta-analysis, this study identifies transcriptional, immunological, and struc- tural pathways to melanoma metastasis and highlights keratin family genes as promising biomarkers for therapeutic targeting.'
