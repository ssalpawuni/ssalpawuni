causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 HCC is the ninth most frequent cause of cancer-related fatalities in 
the US. The number of cases and fatalities continues to rise despite 
advancements in screening, prevention strategies, and new diagnostic and 
therapeutic technologies. Regardless of the source, cirrhosis remains the 
most significant risk factor for HCC development. Cirrhosis can develop
