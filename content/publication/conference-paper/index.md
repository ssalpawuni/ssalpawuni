abstract: 'Due to the presence of censoring in survival data, there has 
been a growing interest in using deep neural networks to deal with the 
complexities of survival datasets. Though a great number of deep neural 
network models have been proposed in recent times, these models usually 
require the development of special loss functions to deal with censoring 
in the data. In this article, we propose a simpler approach to achieving 
the same goal by using jackknife pseudo survival probabilities as a 
quantitative response variable that can be easily handled by a deep 
neural network model. This approach, thus reduces a complex problem 
to a traditional regression problem. Further, our model directly 
outputs the conditional probability of a subject surviving given that 
the subject earlier on survived. This can be a very desirable feature 
from a practical point of view. We name our model as exDeepsurv.'
